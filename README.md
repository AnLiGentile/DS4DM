# DS4DM
The [Data Search for Data Mining (DS4DM)](http://ds4dm.de/) project has the aim of providing (tabular) data search and integration facilities within the popular [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) data mining framework. 
The University of Mannheim team is developing the backend components to:

- preprocess tables from different formats
- index, search and integrate over collected tables, to support the extension of an arbitrary user table with additional attributes
- expose the facilities as a REST Web service that can be used directly within the RapidMiner Data Search extension

The DS4DM backend components include:

- [Preprocessing](./DS4DM_Preprocessing)
- [Backend core](./DS4DM_Backend) (index, search and integration)
- [Search service](./DS4DM_webservice)
